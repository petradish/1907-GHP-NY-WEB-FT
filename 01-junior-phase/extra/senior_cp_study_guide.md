# Senior Checkpoint Study Guide

## What is the senior checkpoint?

A test-spec-based assessment (similar to previous checkpoints, e.g. pillars) covering: Express, Sequelize, React, Redux, and JS algorithms.

## What is it for?

Determining whether you are ready for what's coming in senior phase: whether you will be able to contribute meaningfully to group projects and whether you are in a place to benefit (instead of flounder) from the senior phase curriculum.

## Format

Test-spec based, like all of the previous checkpoints.

## Time frame

Unless otherwise agreed-upon, you will have three hours to complete the Senior Checkpoint.

## Miscellaneous study tips

- In the past, we've heard that (for many) the most difficult part of the checkpoint involved React and forms; we recommend brushing up on handling inputs in react
- Time yourself doing previous / practice checkpoints, diagnose what ends up consuming most of your time, and figure out a plan for mitigating it; *actually* timing yourself can ground you not only in whether you understand the material in general, but also whether you are ready for the pace of the senior checkpoint
- Use flash cards (and [here's a neat flash app](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)), for example for things like "how to write an express route"; effective visualization and recall of common code structure can help keep your momentum going during a checkpoint
- Identify topics you are struggling with and book office hours so we can help you get unstuck
- During the checkpoint, don't forget you can ask questions about the specsâ€”the primary intention of the checkpoint is to determine your understanding of the material, not your ability to read test specs (that's a useful skill, not a *crucial* one at this juncture)

## Some resources

- (Coming soon: the Junior Phase Final Project, which is itself a good way to study for the Senior Checkpoint)
- All of the past and practice checkpoints: special shout-out to **Cody's Quiz** and **Cody's Cafe**; recommended for those who have gotten tripped up on the spec-based format, and want to continue preparing for that
- Study Saturdays: a project-based exercise for practicing our stack with English-instructions, not just specs
- Weekly Summaries: notes about the major takeaways from all the topics we have covered so far; recommended for those looking to study and solidify by reading
