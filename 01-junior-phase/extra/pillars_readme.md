# Checkpoint 3 - Pillars (Express/Sequelize/React)

This checkpoint is primarily to help us understand how well you've absorbed the material covered so far. It covers the main libraries you have learned in the curriculum: Express, Sequelize, and React.

To this end — and perhaps it goes without saying — we ask that you don't help each other or cheat.

## Resources

Suggested:
- Student Notes (can contain anything)
- Documentation
- Lecture slides
- Help tickets (esp in case of specs not running or very basic clarification needed)

Use Sparingly:
- Old checkpoints
- Workshop code
- Stack Overflow
- Copy-pasting

Forbidden:
- Googling the solution code
- Communicating via Slack

## Things we're checking

* Express App Structures
* Express Routing and Route Methods
* Sequelize Model Configuration
* React component creation

## Starting

1. **Fork** this repo to your own github
* Clone your fork to your local machine.
* Make sure your Postgres database is running!
* `npm install`
* You can run `npm test` which will continuously run the test suite on file saves.
* Read through the project structure. You'll be working exclusively in [FILENAMES REDACTED] in that order.
* Start working through the tests in `test/`.  You have to mark them as active (from pending) by changing `xit` to `it`
* `git commit` often as you make progress on the tests.

These tests include [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest).

## IMPORTANT TIPS FOR SUCCESS

* **READ ALL COMMENTS CAREFULLY.** Specs often assume you have read the comments, and many specs have links to relevant documentation.
* After you have correctly defined the model's fields, you can probably run all the remaining model and route specs in *any order* (note, not 100% guaranteed). So if you get stuck, **move on and try some other specs**.
* You should `git commit` very frequently — even for each passing spec if you like! This will prevent you from losing work.
* If you are uncertain what a spec is doing or asking of you, or you've gotten stuck, *ask for help*. We may not be able to give you any hints, but you won't know if you don't ask, and sometimes the problem is technical rather than related to the checkpoint itself.
* Please don't commit `console.log`s and other debug code.

## Submitting

As you complete each answer (or make an update), please commit the changes to the git repository.  To submit your answers:

1. `git commit -am 'submission for deadline'`
* `git push origin master`
