# In Class Checkpoint Resources

### Allowed:

- Student Notes (these **must** be hand-written, and can span **no more than 8 pages, front and back**)
- Documentation
- Lecture slides
- Help tickets (especially in case of specs not running or very basic clarification needed)

### Important Caveat to Allowed Resources:

- **Notes**: Your notes should be the distillation of your understanding of the materials, not large swaths of code samples. To that end:
  - Notes should not contain code blocks from forbidden resources
  - Code blocks you **do** include should be short and new
  - **Short** means about 3 lines of code per associated thought/note block (this is a rough guideline on purpose
  - **New** means it should be sample code you write fresh representing key ideas, not code passing specific prior test specs or code lifted from workshop solutions
- **Copy & Paste**: All code you write during this checkpoint should be hand-typed, including code samples that come from your allowed resources

 ### Forbidden:

- Workshop code, including solution code to workshops
- Solution code to checkpoints, including this one
- Searching for answers in any search engine, including (but not limited to) Stack Overflow, Google, Bing, Ask.com, Yahoo Answers, Quora, etc.
- Communication via Slack (Slack must absolutely be turned off during this checkpoint)

### Lastly:

The purpose of this checkpoint is for you to write code that demonstrates what you've learned so far, and for us to be able to to work with you if there are gaps in your knowledge.  Cheating on the test simply to pass it robs all of us of the ability to work together on your journey, and jeopardizes your spot in the program.
