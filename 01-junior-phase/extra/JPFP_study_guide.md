# Junior Phase Final Project Study Guide

## What is the Junior Phase Final Project?

A reasonably large solo project you will work on during week 5 of junior phase.

## What is it for?

Determining whether you are ready for what's coming in senior phase: whether you will be able to contribute meaningfully to group projects and whether you are in a place to benefit (instead of flounder) from the senior phase curriculum.

## Format

No test specs, only descriptions of what you are supposed to build, including wireframes. All necessary details will be shared with you when you start it.

## Time frame

Roughly three days, see your calendar for exact details.

## Miscellaneous study tips

- Redux (especially `react-redux` and more generally integrating Redux into the frontend of an application) has historically been challenging for people during the project, so we recommend spending some quality study time on that â€” if you feel you are not finding good study resources, please reach out so that we can help
- Study Saturdays are a particularly good way to prepare for the JPFP because the format is quite similar
- We recommend you plan to work on the project out of class, or at least leave that option open; talk to family members / roommates / whomever else about this ahead of time
- Sleep is still super important! Same with taking breaks. We encourage you to give it your all, but that means working smarter, not just harder

## Some resources

- Study Saturdays: a project-based exercise for practicing our stack with English-instructions, not just specs
- Weekly Summaries: notes about the major takeaways from all the topics we have covered so far; recommended for those looking to study and solidify by reading
