Q: In your own words, what is responsive design’?

<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>
A: As developers, we need to create UIs that render well across and ever-increasing variety of devices. Rather than create specific designs for specific devices, we’d rather create one family of designs that flows well from the smallest of smartphone screens, to the largest of desktops. Media Queries and responsive units (em, vh, vw, %, etc) make this a lot easier.

Q: CSS, HTML, and JS are all different languages that serve specific purposes in the rendering of a web app. What do they do, and how do they mesh together?

<details><summary>Click for answer</summary>
A: HTML provides the skeleton content of a web page or app, including text, hyperlinks, and images. CSS is the styling layer. It can even be leveraged to create animations on certain browser events. JS allows us to programmatically control the DOM: adding/removing CSS properties, and handle user events more robustly.
